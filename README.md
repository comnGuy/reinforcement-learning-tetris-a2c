# Reinforcement Learning A2C - One-Block Tetris

This repository contains an implemantation of A2C with Tensorflow to solve a One-Block Tetris problem. Why only one block? Cause the amount of converging is less.

## Getting started

This repository is tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.8.5 64-bit. To start just execute the following steps.

1. `pip install requirement.txtÂ´

2. If you want install tensorflow with GPU support go to `https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu`
